## Who am I?
I'm Altay, a mechanical engineer-turned AI and deep learning person. I started doing an industrial PhD at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) in September 2024 with a focus on 3D CAD and deep generative models. My dream is to be able to *teach machines how to design and build other machines*. All coolness aside, that would drastically accelerate and (hopefully) improve designs and the efficiency of machines that engineers design.

I also love reading books about science, technology, and psychology. I find it fascinating how a seemingly "blind" process like evolution can result in the amazing variety we see in the animal kingdom and something like the human brain. Listening to audiobooks of memoirs or biographies of interesting people is another favourite past-time of mine. So you can expect to find some insights or summaries of those on this page!


## Why am I Writing This Blog?
I love learning new things and always struggled to make sure I don't forget about the ideas and concepts I learn. I felt like postponing making Anki flashcards for months or writing unorganised notes in a personal knowledge management system that I forget about is not the best way to do so. From courses like [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera, I learned the importance of recall practice and working through the material deeply. So I had to figure out how to do that in a sustainable and practical way.

I believe explaining complex things in an intuitive and understandable way is the best method to actually learn it yourself. You have to remember what you studied, summarize it, and present it in a structured way for others to understand. Writing easy-to-understand but detailed and comprehensive technical posts is what I want to do here. That's what brings me to my little corner of the internet to share the stuff I learn. Even if it helps one person understand something they did not understand before, that would be a success in my books :)

## Acknowledgements
I love the amazing blog of [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/), so the style and content are greatly inspired by it. I'm also thankful to the Turkish YouTuber Barış Özcan and especially [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQEKkTug1Zk) from him that talks about the importance of sharing what you learn with the world and creating something new.
