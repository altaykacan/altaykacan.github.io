## Who am I?
I'm Altay, a mechanical engineer-turned AI and deep learning person. I started doing an industrial PhD at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) in September 2024 with a focus on 3D CAD and deep generative models. My dream is to be able to *teach machines how to design and build other machines*. All coolness aside, that would drastically accelerate and improve all the machines that engineers design.

I also love reading books about science, technology, and psychology. I find it fascinating how a seemingly "blind" process like evolution can result in the amazing variety we see in the animal kingdom and something like the human brain. Listening to audiobooks of memoirs or biographies of interesting people is another favourite past-time of mine. So you can expect to find some insights or summaries of those on this page!


## Why am I Writing This Blog?
I love learning new things and always struggled to make sure I don't forget about the ideas and concepts I learn. I felt like postponing making Anki flashcards for months or writing unorganised notes in a personal knowledge management system that I forget about is not the best way to do so. From courses like [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera, I learned the importance of recall practice and working through the material deeply. So I had to figure out how to do that in a sustainable and practical way.

I believe explaining complex things in an intuitive and understandable way is the best method to actually learn it yourself. Writing easy-to-understand but still detailed and comprehensive technical posts is what I want to do here. That's what brings me to my little corner of the internet to share the stuff I learn. Even if it helps one person understand something they did not understand before, that would be a success in my books :)

## Acknowledgements
I love the amazing blog of Lilian Weng [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/), so the style and content are greatly inspired by it. For the name, I was inspired by the soundtrack of one of my favorite game series by Kan Gao and [Freebird Games](https://freebirdgames.com/). The song is called *"Tangents of Peculiarity"*, I thought it sounded cool and I love the games. You can check them out [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182620/Impostor_Factory/). One last thanks goes to Jan Raasch for creating this beautiful and minimalistic theme, [Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog)!
