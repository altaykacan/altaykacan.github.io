# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to *Tangents of Thought*. This is my little corner of the internet where I share and document my learning. You can expect to find posts about machine learning, deep generative models, computer vision, 3D <abbr title="Computer-Aided Design">CAD</abbr>, and engineering.

Head on to the [About](/about) page to learn more about who I am and why this blog exists.

If you want to dive straight in to the technical posts, check out [Building Machines](/machines). I am currently focusing on those and paper summaries. So the second part of this blog, [Being Human](/humans) is currently empty.

Hope you enjoy reading some of my posts and find them useful :)
